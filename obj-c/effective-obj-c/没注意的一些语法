1, obj-c和其他面向对象语言（如java）的最大的区别是啥？

char *answer = "Obj-c依赖与消息发送机制，即任何类型都是运行时绑定的，不同于其他语言的只有在多态时才动态绑定。                      Obj-c的动态绑定不是由编译器来完成的";

My favorite scenes are (in this order)
1) The attack of the Rohirrim
2) Eowyn’s fight with the witch king
   * this was already my favorite scene in the book
   * I really like Miranda Otto.
3) Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
– on DVD only
He makes a really funny face when it happens.
But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
Important actors in this film are:
– Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
– Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo’s friend. I still remember
him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in the Goonies.
